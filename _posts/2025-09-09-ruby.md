### What are Ruby, Gem, Bundler?

Think of the Ruby world as three stacked Lego bricks:

- Ruby itself – the language runtime (the “engine”).
- Gem – Ruby’s single-library package manager (one brick at a time).
- Bundler – the project-level multi-library resolver (the whole Lego set for one project).

Below is the long-form tour.

- Ruby
 An interpreted, object-oriented scripting language (like Python, Perl, Lua).
 Ships with a small standard library (File, Net::HTTP, JSON, etc.).
 Anything not in the standard library has to be installed separately → enter “gems”.

 - Gem
A gem is a plain `*.gem` file: code + metadata (name, version, author, dependencies).  
gem install rails downloads the rails gem and its runtime dependencies into the system-wide Ruby installation (by default under …/ruby/X.Y.Z/lib/ruby/gems/…).
gem list, gem uninstall, gem push etc. are the low-level tools.
Gems are global unless you fiddle with GEM_HOME/GEM_PATH.
Problem: two projects on the same machine may need different versions of the same gem → version conflicts.

- Bundler (bundle, bundler)

Bundler is itself a gem (gem install bundler).
Adds a project layer: every project gets its own Gemfile that declares exact gems + versions it needs.
Running `bundle install`
– computes a full dependency graph,
– writes the exact snapshot to Gemfile.lock,
– downloads missing gems,
– can optionally keep them inside the project (vendor/bundle) or in a shared path by `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'`

### Typical workflow

1. Install ruby & bundler
```bash
ruby -v                    # make sure Ruby is installed
gem install bundler        # one-time global install
```
2. Edit Gemfile

```bash
bundle init                # creates an empty Gemfile
```
`bundle init` will create an empty `Gemfile`.

```Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.3'
gem 'rake',   '~> 13.0'
```

3. Install Gems

```bash
bundle install             # resolves & installs
```
`bundle install` will resolve depedencies and create gems.  

Locked gems will be written in `Gemfile.lock`.  

4. Run with locked gems

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve   # run with locked gems
```
