| `git clone`           | create a clone of a remote Git repository onto your local machine<br>ðŸŽˆ`--recursive`: If the repository contains submodules, this option initializes and clones them as well.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--branch <branch>`: Clone a specific branch instead of the default branch. <br>ðŸŽˆ`--quiet`: Reduce the output during the cloning process.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--no-remote`: skips the creation of a remote reference to the original repository, making the cloned repository independent of the remote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `git checkout`        | used for switching between different branches, restoring files, and creating new branches.<br>ðŸŽˆ`<branch-name>`: switch from one branch to another.<br>ðŸŽˆ`-- <file>`: restore a file (or multiple files) to its state in the latest commit on your current branch. This is helpful if you have modified a file but want to discard your changes.<br>ðŸŽˆ`<commit-hash>`: go to a specific commit. Your git will enter detached `HEAD` state.<sup>1</sup><br>ðŸŽˆ`<commit-hash> -- <file-path>`: checkout a specific file from a specific commit. This does not detach your `HEAD`.<sup>1</sup><br>ðŸŽˆ`<branch-name> -- <file>`: checkout individual files from another branch<br>ðŸŽˆ `-b <new-branch-name>`: create a new branch and switch to the new branch. |
| `git push`            | ðŸŽˆ`<remote> <tagname>` push a specific tag<br>ðŸŽˆ`--tags`: push all tags<br>ðŸŽˆ`--force`: Overwrites the remote branch with your local branch, potentially losing commits on the remote. Use with extreme caution.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--force-with-lease`: A safer alternative to `--force`. It only overwrites the remote branch if your local branch is based on the same commit as the remote branch, preventing accidental overwrites if someone else has pushed changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `git pull`            | used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge those changes into your current branch.<br>ðŸŽˆ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `git tag`<sup>3</sup> | list all tags<br>ðŸŽˆ`<tagname>` Creates a tag to the current commit.<sup>2</sup><br>ðŸŽˆ`-a <tagname> -m "message"`: Creates a tag with a message<sup>2</sup><br>ðŸŽˆ`<tagname> <commit-hash>`: tag a specific commit<sup>2</sup><br>ðŸŽˆ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `git blame`           | shows who last modified each line of a file, along with the commit hash and timestamp.<br>ðŸŽˆ`<file>`: The file to inspect.<br>ðŸŽˆ`-L <start>,<end>`: Restrict the blame output to the given line range.<br>ðŸŽˆ`-e`: Show author's email instead of name.<br>ðŸŽˆ`git blame -w -C -C -C -L 15,26 <file>`: A more advanced example. This command will find the original author of lines 15-26 in the specified file, with the following behavior:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-w`: Ignores whitespace-only changes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-C -C -C`: This is the most aggressive search for finding the origin of moved or copied code, even from different files across different commits.<br>In short, it's a powerful way to trace the true origin of a specific block of code.|
|`git log`         | shows the commit history of the current branch.<br>ðŸŽˆ`-p`: Show the patch introduced with each commit.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--oneline`: Show the commit history in a condensed one-line format.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--graph`: Display the commit history as a text-based graph.<br>ðŸŽˆ`-L <start>,<end>:<file>`: Trace the evolution of a specific line range within a file, showing commits that changed that code block.|
|`git reflog`      | records every change to `HEAD` (and other references) in your local repository, allowing you to recover lost commits.<br>ðŸŽˆ`show`: (default) Shows the reflog entries.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--all`: Shows reflog entries for all branches and other references.|
|`git rebase`      | reapplies commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history. Useful for cleaning up commit history before merging.<br>ðŸŽˆ`<base>`: Rebase the current branch onto `<base>`.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--onto <newbase> <oldbase> <branch>`: Rebase a specific range of commits onto a new base.<br><br>**Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)**<br>Performs an interactive rebase, allowing you to modify individual commits (e.g., squash, reword, reorder, delete) during the rebase process.<br>ðŸŽˆ`<base>`: Interactively rebase commits up to `<base>`.<br>**Note:** This command rewrites history and should be used with caution, especially on shared branches.|
|`git diff`        | shows changes between commits, working tree, etc.<br>ðŸŽˆ`--word-diff`: Shows changes on a word-by-word basis, highlighting individual words that have changed within a line. Useful for text documents or code with minor inline edits.|
|`git commit --amend`| Used to modify the most recent commit. You can change the commit message, add/remove files, or combine multiple small changes into one commit.<br>**Note:** This command rewrites history and should be used with caution, especially on shared branches.|


- 1: `HEAD` is a pointer that points to the latest commit of current branch. If `HEAD` is detached, it means you are not on any branch. You can see where `HEAD` points to by running `cat .git/HEAD`.

- 2: By default, tags are not pushed to remote. Refer to `git push` to push your tags to remote.

- 3: Tags are stored in `.git/refs/tags`.

| `column.ui auto`  | Automatically enables columnar display for `git status`, `git branch`, `git tag`, and other commands when the output is going to a terminal. This makes the output more readable by aligning columns.<br>To set this globally: `git config --global column.ui auto`|
